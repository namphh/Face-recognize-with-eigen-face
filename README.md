# Face-recognize-with-eigen-face
Eigenface:

A face recognition method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Uses a dataset of facial images to create a set of "eigenfaces" (principal faces).
Each new face is represented as a linear combination of the eigenfaces.
Compares these linear coefficients to recognize faces.

In this problem, we use Haar Cascade algorithm for reshape imgame for room in font of face.
